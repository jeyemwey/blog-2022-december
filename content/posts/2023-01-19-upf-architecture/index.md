Barcelona's [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://upf.edu) has some truly amazing architecture at its _Campus de la Ciutudella_.
From what I understand, I mostly discovered the Law Department and some Library building.
All pictures are taken with my Google Pixel 4a 5G in Normal mode.

{{< picture "images/atrium.jpg" "Two buildings with a inner floor that has a large roof. The left building has a wooden design, the right one has a large glass front in which you can see some lecture halls." >}}
{{< picture "images/lecturehalls.jpg" "Three floors of lecture halls. The highest floor is dimmed, the middle floor has a cinema-style seating, the lowest floor looks like a cafeteria." >}}

The next building has a beautiful courtyard under which the library seems to be.

I love how the old structures and modern buildings are combined:

Oh, and here's another image from the adjacent metro station:
